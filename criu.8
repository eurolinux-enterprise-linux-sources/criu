.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcriu\fR \fI<command>\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBcriu\fR is a tool for checkpointing and restoring running applications\&. It does this by saving their state as a collection of files (see the \fIdump\fR command) and creating equivalent processes from those files (see the \fIrestore\fR command)\&. The restore operation can be performed at a later time, on a different system, or both\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
The options are depending on the \fI<command>\fR \fBcriu\fR run with\&.
.SS "Common options"
.sp
Common options are applied to any \fI<command>\fR\&.

.RE
.SS "pre\-dump"
.sp
Launches that named pre\-dump procedure, where \fBcriu\fR does snapshot of memory changes since previous pre\-dump\&. Also \fBcriu\fR forms fsnotify cache which speedup \fBrestore\fR procedure\&. \fBpre\-dump\fR requires at least \fB\-t\fR option (see \fBdump\fR below)\&. Optionally \fBpage\-server\fR options may be specified\&.

\fI<pid>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-leave\-running\fR
.RS 4
Leave tasks in running state after checkpoint instead of killing them\&. This option is pretty dangerous and should be used if and only if you understand what you are doing\&.
.sp
If task is about to run after been checkpointed it can modify TCP connections, delete files and do other dangerous actions\&. So that
\fBcriu\fR
itself can not guarantee that the next
\fBrestore\fR
action will not fail\&. Most likely if a user starts
\fBcriu\fR
with this option passed at least the file system snapshot must be done with help of
\fIpost\-dump\fR
script\&.
.sp
In other words, do not use it until really needed\&.
.RE

.RE

command)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-file\-locks\fR

Dump file locks\&. It is necessary to make sure that all file lock users are taken into dump, so it is only safe to use this for enclojured containers where locks are not holed by someone outside of it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-ext\-mount\-map\fR \fI<KEY>\fR\fB:\fR\fI<VAL>\fR

Allow one to specify maximum allowed size of deleted file to be carried inside image files\&. By default up to 1M file is allowed\&. It is done in a sake to not carry big files inside images\&.
\fIsize\fR
may be postfixed with
\fIK\fR,
\fIM\fR
or
\fIG\fR
(which stands for kilo, mega and gigabytes accordingly)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-shell\-job\fR
.RS 4
Allow one to dump shell jobs\&. This implies the restored task will inherit session and process group ID from the criu itself\&. Also this option allows one to migrate a single external tty connection, in other words this option allows one to migrate such application as "top" and friends\&. If passed on
\fBdump\fR
it must be specified on
\fBrestore\fR
as well\&.
.RE
.PP

CPU capability to be written into an image file\&. Basically if
\fI<cap>\fR
is one of
\fBall\fR,
\fBcpu\fR
or
\fBins\fR, then
\fBcriu\fR
writes CPU related information into image file\&. If the option is omitted or set to

\fBcriu\fR
do not write this image\&.
